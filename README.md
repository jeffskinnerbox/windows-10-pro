# Windows 10 Pro on Linux
With few exceptions, I have abandon MicroSoft Windows OS for Linux.
I do find an occasional need for MS Windows for some odd MS Windows program I may wish to run,
but the only constant need is filing my annual income tax using TurboTax.
When it comes to Linux,
you have a few options to consider to fill in for the Windows program void.
The specific options I explored for TurboTax tax filing:

1. **Native Linux -**
In some cases, you can find Linux programs that claim some equivalency to the MS Windows version.
There happens to be at least one such package for filling taxes.
    * [Use Linux to do your taxes][01]
1. **Bottles / Wine -**
Wine is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on Linux.
Instead of simulating internal Windows logic like a virtual machine or emulator,
Wine translates Windows API calls into Linux calls on-the-fly.
Bottles is a wrapper around Wine, simplifying and automating some tasks.
    * [How to Run Windows Software on Linux With Bottles][02]
1. **Proxmox -**
Proxmox is an open-source, Type 1 hypervisor that comes as a Debian-based Linux distribution.
With Proxmox, users can experience a hypervisor that can integrate Linux containers (LXC),
KVM hypervisor virtual machines, networking functionality, and software-defined storage in a unified platform.
([Windows 10 downloads required][03]).

    * [HowTo install & configure Windows 10 in a VM on Proxmox VE 7.1 - step-by-step][08]
1. **Vagrant/VirtualBox -**
Oracle VM VirtualBox is a type-2 hypervisor for x86 virtualization package
supporting a large number of guest operating systems.
Vagrant is a wrapper around VirtualBox that provides some portability across many
hypervisors like VirtualBox, KVM, Hyper-V, VMware, etc.
Pre-built VMs are provided, including for MicroSoft Windows
(e.g. [gusztavvargadr/windows-10][05]).
    * [How to Install Windows 10 in a Virtual Machine][06]

The Proxmox and Vagrant/VituralBox solutions worked well for me,
and I settled in on using the latter.

>**NOTE:** Beware of the "Guru Meditation" error.
>This is a VirtualBox error that I got, and in my case, it was cause by a incompatibility
>between VirtualBox and KVM.
>The solution was to remove KVM, or at least stop its operations temporarily.

# Windows 10 Pro VM
Now that multiple Vagrant boxes are available for Windows 10
(e.g. Vagrant Cloud repository [`baunegaard/win10pro-en`][09]),
I have no need to build my own Vagrant box.
This Vagrant box is set up such that it can share the directory in which the `vagrant` command is executed.
This is great so I can write/read any files I need via this shared directory.

My plan is to load this Windows 10 VM with TurboTax and file my taxes.
My TurboTax is on a CD-ROM, therefore I want to load that software directly from the CD.
To do this, I need the CD/DVD optical reader on my host computer to share with the MS Windows 10 guest VM.

## Creating the Windows 10 VM Vagrantfile
Using the Vagrant base box [`baunegaard/win10pro-en`][09],
I need to create a Vagrantfile to meet my needs stated above.
To derive the Vagrantfile,
I experimented with provisioning VirtualBox directly using [VBoxManage][10]
and leveraged the learnings from [jeffskinnerbox / Windows-10-Vagrant-Box][11].
